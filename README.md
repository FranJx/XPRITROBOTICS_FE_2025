# - XpriT Robotics – WRO 2025 Future Engineers
## Introduction

We are **XpriT Robotics**, a team dedicated to creating robotics projects for participation in various competitions. Our main focus is on education and knowledge sharing, using challenges as opportunities to grow and inspire others. 
Through our projects, we explore robotics and engineering challenges to expand our skills, creativity, and experience.
For this competition, we aim to design a robot capable of avoiding obstacles, completing a circuit, and parking in a designated area.

This repository contains the engineering materials of our autonomous vehicle model developed by **XpriT Robotics**, competing in the **WRO 2025 Future Engineers** category. It includes source code, documentation, design files, photos, schematics, and a driving demonstration video.
