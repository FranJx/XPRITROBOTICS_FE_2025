## - XpriT Robotics – WRO 2025 Future Engineers

### Engineering Materials

This repository contains the engineering materials of our autonomous vehicle model developed by **XpriT Robotics**, competing in the **WRO 2025 Future Engineers** category. It includes source code, documentation, design files, photos, schematics, and a driving demonstration video.

### Repository Structure

* [**t-photos**](#t-photos/) – Two team photos: a formal one and a funny group shot.
* [**r-photos**](#r-photos/) – Six images of the vehicle: front, back, left, right, top, and bottom.
* [**videos**](#videos/) – A Video of the robot driving.
* [**schemes**](#schemes/) – Electromechanical schematic diagrams showing how components connect. 
* [**3Dmodels**](#3Dmodels/) – Files for 3D-printed pieces of the robot
* [**Code**](#Code/) – Robot code for Arduino Nano
* **Engineering Journal** – A journal where describes the decisions we made along the project, project description and step-by-step guide to build our robot.
